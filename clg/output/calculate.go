// Package output implements spec.CLG and provides one of the two very special
// CLGs. That is the output CLG. Its purpose is to check if the calculated
// output matches the provided expectation, if any expectation given. The
// output CLG is handled in a special way because it determines the end of all
// requested calculations within the neural network. After the output CLG has
// been executed, the calculated output is returned back to the requesting
// client.
