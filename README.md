# annad
The annad package implements a command line tool to run the neural network of
the anna project. Anna, Artificial Neural Network Aspiration, aims to be
self-learning and self-improving software.

# abstract
> AI is the last invention humanity will ever need to make.

This is not about machine learning. This is about machines learn to learn. This
is about general purpose artificial intelligence. Machine learning with all
its scientific theories and approaches is still way too rigid. To make AI
actually work we need to make them as dynamic as possible. The way to a truly
intelligent system is probably so hard and long nobody can just code it right
away. Humanity needs to discover the path of creating something flexible and
smart as human brains sometimes pretend to be. Walking this very long road
alone seems to be insane. Since the industrial revolution machines helped us to
faster achieve better results. We aim to go along the way to AI, step by step,
with Anna together. See the [roadmap](doc/roadmap) for an idea about the
various stages this project aims to reach.

Anyway, this project is still pretty new. For quite a while now I am thinking
about machine learning and AI. This field is fascinating and challenging in so
many different ways. I want to use this project as playground to improve
knowledge by solving problems pragmatically.

In fact the aim is to implement something living. Something that learns and
develops by itself. Something that solves the problems we are not capable of.
This ambitious dream should drive this project. Wether it is driven by me,
somebody else, or some group of people way smarter than me. Life will find a
way.
