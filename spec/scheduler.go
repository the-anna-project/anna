// Action represents any work to be done when executing a job.
//
// The given args represents some arbitrary structure being configured at job
// creation and passed through during job execution. The given closer signals
// the jobs end when the scheduler decides to do so. This happens e.g. when the
// job's final status was manually set. That way an operator can finish a task
// and cancel the corresponding goroutine by setting the job's final state in
// the used storage.
//
// In case the work done within the action callback was successful, there might
// be some result returned. Then this is accessible using Job.GetResult.
//
// In case there was an error returned, it will be accessible using
// Job.GetError. Note that this only obtains the error's message, not the
// underlying structure of the original error object.

// Scheduler represents a scheduler object that manages jobs and their
// executions.

	// error is immediately returned in case the configured action is not

	// MarkAsActive marks the given job as active and persists the job's state.
	// The returned job is actually the refreshed version of the provided one.
	MarkAsActive(job Job) (Job, error)

	// MarkAsFailedWithError marks the given job as failed, adds information of
	// the given error to it and persists the job's state. The returned job is
	// actually the refreshed version of the provided one.

	// MarkAsInactive marks the given job as inactive and persists the job's
	// state. The returned job is actually the refreshed version of the provided
