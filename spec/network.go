// Network provides a neural network based on dynamic and self improving CLG

// back to the requestor.
type Network interface {
	// TODO
	// Activate decides if the requested CLG should be activated. To make this
	// decision the given network payload and formerly received network payloads
	// are considered. CLGs within the neural network are able to join forces to
	// trigger a CLG together, where their own output types do not satisfy the
	// input interface of the requested CLG. For this case some synchronization is
	// required. That means network payloads need to be queued until the requested
	// CLG can be properly executed with the provided inputs. Activate tries to
	// find a combination using all queued network payloads to satisfy the
	// interface of the requested CLG. Note that queue has a maximum length of the
	// number of input arguments of the requested CLG. In case no match can be
	// found the oldest network payload is removed from the queue, because a new
	// network payload was added before. In case some match was found the merged
	// network payload matching the CLG's interface is returned so it can be used
	// to execute the requested CLG. Network payloads being matched will be
	// removed from the queue which is returned as second value. This is how it
	// might look like when multiple CLGs forward signals to one CLG, which needs
	// to decide if it should be actiavted or not.

	// network payload, the CLG's connections and its therefore resulting
