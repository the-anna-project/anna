// Network provides a neural network based on dynamic and self improving CLG

	// Activate decides if the requested CLG should be activated. To make this
	// decision the given network payload and formerly received network payloads
	// are considered. CLGs within the neural network are able to join forces to
	// trigger a CLG together, where their own output types do not satisfy the
	// input interface of the requested CLG. For this case some synchronization
	// is required. That means network payloads need to be queued until the
	// requested CLG can be properly executed with the provided inputs. That is
	// why Activate takes a single payload, which represents the currently
	// received one, and a list of network payloads, which represent the formerly
	// received network payloads. Activate tries to find a combination of all
	// known payloads that satisfy the interface of the requested CLG. Note that
	// queue has a maximum length of the number of input arguments of the
	// requested CLG. In case no match can be found the given single payload is
	// added to queue and the oldest payload is removed. In case some match was
	// found the unified network payload matching the CLG's interface is returned
	// so it can be used for the requested CLG execution. Network payloads being
	// matched will be removed from the new queue which is returned as second
	// value.

	// one or more CLGs. All this depends on the information provided by the
	// given network payload, the CLG's connections and its therefore resulting
