# development
This document describes the development environment and its processes.

### setup
At first, clone the repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:xh3b4sd/anna.git
```

Fetching all dependencies works with this.
```
make goget
```

Just running the code without installing the binary can be achieved using the
go tools.
```
make gorun
```

Cleanup the workspace can be done with this.
```
make goclean
```

Running all tests works that way.
```
make gotest
```

### pull requests

###### commits
Pull requests are only accepted and merged when there is only one commit to be
merged. This means contributers need to squash their commits before. This can
be done with the following command.
```
git rebase -i master
```

---

###### diary
Pull requests are only accepted and merged when there is some sort of process
documentation. Goal of this is to keep track of influences and events that
drove development and decisions. All ideas and walkthroughs are precious and
good to know.

---

###### tests
Make sure there are tests where it makes sense and all tests pass reliably. No
pull request is going to be merged as long as there are tests failing.

### guidelines

###### tracability
Having insides into complex systems is key. Events going through neural
networks need to be highly comprehensible in detail. Data needs to be
collected. All information we can gather need to be visualized somehow.

---

###### plugability
A plugable architecture having decent interfaces ...

---

###### testability
Functionality needs to be guaranteed by testing actual software
implementations. Automated. Painless. Fast.

---

###### data formats
For simplicity JSON should be good enough for now.

---

###### API's
There are two forms of API's we want to care about here. Library interfaces and
network API's.

Library interfaces should always be well defined. Software packages of this
project need to have a real purpose on their own, so they can stand alone, or
be used by something else.

Network API's should always be well defined. They should simply represent
business logic implementation wrapped by some network protocol middleware.
