# cheat sheet
Here are we collect some useful snippets to ease some pains that may occur
during development.

### search and replace
The following snippet can be used to easily search and replace strings
recursively within a given directory. Here `search` is replaced by `replace`
within all files which names match the expression `*.go` within the current
directory given by `.`. To accomplish that we make use of the command line
tools `sed` and `find`.
```
sed -i 's/search/replace/g' $(find . -name *.go)
```
