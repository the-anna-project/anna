This is the 33th diary entry. Electrical systems are not biological systems.

This might sounds obvious, but I start to more and more understand and even feel
that. Structures like they occur in nature cannot simply copied and build with
code. The current design of the neural network is still too complicated. It is
not clean. I now pursue an approach using a task system. I think this will give
more controle over the communication processes within the neural network.
