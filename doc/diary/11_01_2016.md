This is the very first diary entry. Besides the actual visible work, some
mental work happened before. Results of preceeding brainstorming will be
documented where appropriate.

What happened so far was the initial repository creation and project structure
setup. The programming language used is [golang](https://golang.org/), because
I am quite familiar with it. It is a very nice language providing decent
concurrency patterns. Thus the project setup was rather a pain since the
concept of golangs workspaces is, lets say, suboptimal. A Makefile is required
to ease development. Initial documentation was written. See [doc](doc/).
