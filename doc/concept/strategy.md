# strategy
A strategy is an ordered chain of [CLGs](clg.md). A strategy can be well known
and provided by the [knowledge network](knowledge_network.md), or be unknown.
Then a completely new strategy is created. The process of creating a strategy
is fully dynamic and reproducible. Here some implementation of a [permutation
factory](permutation_factory) ensures performance and reproducibility.
