# impulse
The life cycle of an impulse begins when a signal is send over a
[gateway](gateway.md). Impulses are used to transport context related
information and trigger actions within the core network where they are going
through. Any [input](input.md), [expectation](expectation.md),
[strategy](strategy.md) and [output](output.md) is attached to impulses. These
objects are carried around until some problem is solved. At the end of an
impulse's life cycle the calculated output is returned.
