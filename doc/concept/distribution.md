# distribution
A distribution is a calculation object that describes the distribution of
vectors within space. This vectors can be of arbitrary dimensions. That way
characteristics of features and their location in space can be represented and
alanysed. See https://godoc.org/github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/spec#Distribution for
implementation details.

### balance system
The distribution can be used a balance system. That describes the amount of
impulses and how harmonic or extreme the distribution of these currently is
within a system. That way the state of an organism can be represented. Extremes
of impulse occurrence cause imbalance within the organism. Extremes can be seen
as low or high.

No impulses at all represent a low extreme. This is the bar chart
representation of no impulses.
```
x  x  x

1  2  3
```

To many impulses at the same time represent a high extreme. This is the bar
chart representation of too many impulses.
```
      x
      x
      x
      x
x  x  x

1  2  3
```

The organism's motivation is the balance of the impulse distribution. This is
the bar chart representation of a more balanced distribution of impulses.
```
      x
x     x
x  x  x
x  x  x
x  x  x

1  2  3
```

As we see there are different channels obtaining their own impulse population.
This can indicate different evaluations of whatever is going on within the
organism. Each channel has an separate input and an separate output. Pushing
an impulse to the input of one channel causes the impulse distribution for the
given channel to increase. The whole impulse population within a balance
system is capped. In case the overall impulse population is already saturated,
an adaption of the other channels happens automatically. That means, that at
the same time some input is received on one channel, some output is received on
the other channels. The population of one channel increases and the population
of the other channels decreases symmetrically. Having three saturated channels
and one channel pushes an impulse, the value of it is divided by two and
population worth the half of the pushed impulse is decreased from the other two
channels, causing a balance or imbalance.

# weighted analysis
Weighted analysis can represent vector population within space. The more
channels the distribution has the more differentiations can be made between
vectors being located within channels. E.g. analysing sequence features
requires an abstracted way of representing patterns. Using a distribution
feature locations within sequences can be visualized and compared. Thinking
about the sequence `.`, humans instantly recognize the period and associate the
location being the end of a sentence. Since all this thinking is obvious for
humans, it is not for machines. The distribution helps to find out that the
sequence `.` is in fact a feature, because it can be detected as recurring
pattern. The distribution for the feature `.` would look something like this,
because periods are almost always located at the end of sentences.
