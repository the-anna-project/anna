# connection
The connection model is the most important concept of the Anna project. A
connection can be seen as a neural connection. Such connections represent
relationships between certain information and bevahiors, represented in a
multi dimensional space. [Inputs](input.md), [outputs](output.md) and
[CLGs](clg.md) are wired together that way. Many of these connections joined
together form Anna's neural [network](network.md).

### space
The connection space can be seen as a multi dimensional vector space. In theory
it's dimensions can represent everything: space, time or even conceptional
weights representing something like emotions. Information and behaviors are
mapped onto the connection space. Here similarities between information, and
similarities between behaviors can be calculated. In the connection space
information are represented by the coordinates of input trees. Each vector,
that is a list of coordinates, reflects one character. The distance calculation
is done with respect to the input tree's coordinates. You can think of the
joined coordinates of the input tree as a drawn information path in multi
dimensional space. Information paths in the surrounding area are evidence of
some kind of similarity. Over time the information paths are formed while each
dimension is pulling on the peers of the information path into their own
direction. That way a balanced alignment is achieved that makes each
information path unique. The same concept that applies to information paths
also applies to behavior paths, but only on a different problem domain. Here
behavior is mapped to an executable CLG tree, which coordinates are mapped onto
the multi dimensional connection space.

The following picture illustrates the multi dimensional connection space. For
simplicity it only shows three dimensions. Here we see two different paths. It
doesn't matter if they are information or behavior paths. The same principle
applies to each of them. We see some peers are pretty near to each other. A
smaller distance is an indicator for common connection patterns which are
aligned over time.

### creation
When creating new connections it is important not to create weak connections.
Each connection that exists only exists because it brought some kind of value
in the past. The process of creating connections is a continuous task, that is
fully dynamic and learned by experience and can be described as follows. These
strategies are considered when it comes to draw new connections within a multi
dimensional space.

1. Bias is some manually provided hint, intended to guide some connection path
   into a certain direction. Read more on this in this issue:
   https://github.com/xh3b4sd/anna/issues/44.

2. Intuition is some sort of vague feeling that points into a certain
   direction. Drawing distantly related connections across multiple levels can
   gather information and generate new relations between peers.

3. Copy connections from other branches looks up possible connection structures
   from different problem domains. Connections that have been useful in one
   problem domain might be useful as well in another.

4. Random connections can be drawn if none of the preceding options are
   available. This is the most weak way to create new connections, because it
   does not consider any additional information.

### lookup
The process of looking up connections is triggered on demand and thus must be
optimized for fast execution. When information is provided in the form of
[input](input.md), it is mapped onto a multi dimensional space to enable the
lookup of some behavior. The given input translates to a so called input tree,
which coordinates identify it's location within the connection space. Due to
the created connection we already have a mapping between the input tree and the
[CLG](clg.md) tree, which we actually want to lookup. This relationship creates
the link between information and behavior, because the connected CLG tree maps
directly to executable behavior.

### data structure
Designing a data structure is quite important. Smart systems need to store
information efficiently. The wrong data structures will cause even more huge
amounts of data or cause high latency for business logic tasks. The following
data structure design aims to be efficient and fast while meeting the
requirements of Anna's business logic. We use key-value pairs to store data and
describe relations between objects because of simplicity and speed.

The notation of the described data structures reads as follows. Everything
within angle brackets (`<>`) reads as variable. On the left is the key, on the
right is the value of the key-value pairs. `<prefix>` represents some internal
storage prefix simply used to prefix data structures to a certain scope.

###### map input sequence to information ID
When having an input sequence given it needs to be registered. An input
sequence represents some externally provided information as it is in the first
place. Over time input sequences are broken down into their separate features
based on their usage. The following key maps an input sequence to an
information ID.

```
<prefix>:input-sequence:information-id:<input-sequence>    <information-id>
```

---

###### map information ID to input sequence
When having an information ID given it needs to be mapped to an input sequence.
That way a mapping of input sequences broken down into their reusable features
can be achieved. The following key maps an information ID to an input sequence.

```
<prefix>:information-id:input-sequence:<information-id>   <input-sequence>
```

---

###### map information ID to input tree ID
When having an information ID given it needs to be mapped to an input tree ID.
That way a mapping to an organizational structure can be achieved. The
following key maps an information ID to an input tree ID.

```
<prefix>:information-id:input-tree-id:<information-id>   <input-tree-id>
```

---

###### map input tree ID to input tree
When having an input tree ID given it needs to be mapped to an input tree. An
input tree represents an organizational structure that holds ordered
information IDs. Note that one information ID per list needs to be used when
joining the whole input tree's underlying input sequence together. That means
that in case one list needs to be omitted in some cases, the list must contain
the information ID of an empty input sequence. That is, an empty string. The
following key maps an input tree ID to an input tree.

```
<prefix>:input-tree-id:input-tree:<input-tree-id>    [[<information-id>,<information-id>,...],[<information-id>,<information-id>,...],...]
```

---

###### map information ID to information coordinates
When having an information ID given it's position within the connection space
needs to be looked up. Such lookups are necessary when conceptionaly related
connections between input trees are required during operations on information
level. The following key maps an input tree ID to input tree coordinates within
the connection space.

```
<prefix>:information-id:information-coordinates:<input-tree-id>    [<x>,<y>,...],[<x>,<y>,...],...
```

---

###### map information coordinates to information ID
When having information coordinates given they need to be mapped to their
information ID. Having information coordinates indexed as keys enables fast
scans when it needs to be found out which informations are near to the
surrounding area of a given information within the connection space. That way
information can be mapped and aligned to matching information. The following
key maps information coordinates to it's information ID.

```
<prefix>:information-coordinates:information-id:[<x>,<y>,...],[<x>,<y>,...],...    <information-id>
```

---

###### map input tree ID to CLG tree ID
When having an input tree ID given it needs to be mapped to a CLG tree ID. This
is the key that maps information to behavior. The following key maps input tree
coordinates to it's linked input tree ID.

```
<prefix>:input-tree-id:clg-tree-id:<input-tree-id>    <clg-tree-id>
```

---

###### map CLG tree ID to CLG tree
When having a CLG tree ID given it needs to be mapped to a CLG tree. A CLG tree
represents an organizational structure that holds ordered behavior IDs forming
an executable behavior network. A behavior ID is effectively a CLG ID. Note
that a CLG tree can only be valid in case it starts with the ID of the Input
CLG, and ends with the ID of the Output CLG in any branch. The following key
maps an CLG tree ID to a CLG tree.

```
<prefix>:clg-tree-id:clg-tree:<clg-tree-id>    {<behavior-id>: {<behavior-id>: {...}, <behavior-id>: {...}, ...}}
```

---

###### map behavior ID to behavior coordinates
When having a behavior ID given it's position within the connection space needs
to be looked up. The following key maps a behavior ID to behavior coordinates
within the connection space.

```
<prefix>:behavior-id:behavior-coordinates:<behavior-id>    [<x>,<y>,...],[<x>,<y>,...],...
```

---

###### map behavior coordinates to behavior ID
When having behavior coordinates given they need to be mapped to their behavior
ID. Having behavior coordinates indexed as keys enables fast scans when it
needs to be found out which behaviors are near to the surrounding area of a
given behavior within the connection space. That way behavior can be mapped and
aligned to matching behaviors. The following key maps behavior coordinates to
it's behavior ID.

```
<prefix>:behavior-coordinates:behavior-id:[<x>,<y>,...],[<x>,<y>,...],...    <behavior-id>
```
