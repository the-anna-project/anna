# connection
The connection model is the most important concept of the Anna project. It can
be seen as a neural connection. Such a connection represents a relationship
between certain information. Many connections joined to
[strategies](strategy.md) form Anna's neural network.

The following picture illustrates the neural network of information. The white
circles represent peers that are not connected. The red circles represent
information being connected into a certain direction. The direction is
visualized by black arrows. The dotted arrow shows a new connection being made
to extend an already existing strategy path. Creating connections is a process
that itself can be driven by strategies. That way the neural network improves
itself.
