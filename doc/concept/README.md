# concept
Here are concepts documented that drive the development of this project.
Concepts may or may not specific to neural networks. They just describe ideas
or hard facts and hints to give an explanation what is or could be there.
Further they may describe how the project looks like. Concepts are always open
to be discussed, wether they are implemented or not. This page basically
collects information about the whole project. Be it to illustrate how some
architecture looks like, or what cool autocompletions are there for biniaries.
