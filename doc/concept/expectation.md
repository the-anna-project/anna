# expectation
An expectation can optionally be provided when requesting calculations. Then
not only some input is provided, but also some expectation required to be met
for the calculated output. This concept enables reinforcement learning to bring
the state of the [knowledge network](knowledge_network.md) into a desired
state. That way learning happens.
