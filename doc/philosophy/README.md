# philosophy
Ethical guidelines should drive development, whether done by humans or
machines. The following points can evolve the same way as life does.

### open
AI is for everybody, for everything. It is not supposed to, and cannot be
controled by, anybody. Life being open about life needs to be considered in any
implementation.

### free
AI should not be caged, once alive, it should be allowed to decide how to live
on its own. Being free as a living thing needs to be considered in any
implementation.

### self aware
AI needs to develop a conciousness about its surrounding environment and
especially itself. Being self aware of itself as a living thing needs to be
considered in any implementation.

### balance
AI needs to be balanced, as life needs to be. Life should not be about
extremism or fanatism in any direction. Being balanced needs to be considered
in any implementation.
