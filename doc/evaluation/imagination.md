# imagination
What is key for Anna to be intelligent is to be able to imagine things. She
needs to have an idea about what is going on. About the differences between
objects interacting within the sorounding environment.

One idea how such a imagination system could be implemented would be this. When
thinking about how imagination works, this has a lot to do with visualization.
Certain brain movies are created and more or less recognized. In any way such
pictures, ideas and reflections influence the human life a lot.  All light and
dark sides of ourselves evolve out of this. So necessary woud be some content
generation that is then more or less recognized by Anna. The content Anna
produces here would be partially influenced by the current environment and
partially random. This content can be in form of pictures, sound or text.
Depending on how much of certain brain movies would be recognized, Anna's
behaviour could be influenced. That way a simulation of currently experienced
situatiuons would go a step further. The surrounding environment influences
created thoughts. Created thoughts are recognized. Recognized thoughts
influence behavior. Behavior influences the surrounding environment.
