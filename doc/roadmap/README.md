# roadmap
The roadmap describes how the project is planned to be developed in the future.
This plan has the potential to change quickly.

### next 4 weeks

###### annactl
Because of the task system it is necessary to have a client that understands
Annas API's. This is for convenience and for other cool stuff that needs to be
controled remotely.

### next 4 months

###### store data
Consumed input needs to be stored somehow. We can expect huge data amounts of
neural networks that need to be available as fast as possible. Before
implementing something I would like to get an idea of different approaches to
compare needs against technical details. Further backing up and restoring data
also needs to be considered.

###### backup data
For failure recovery and testing purposes it is necessary to backup data
automatically. Fast. Easy. Painless.

###### restore data
For failure recovery and testing purposes it is necessary to restore backed up
data automatically. Fast. Easy. Painless.

### next 4 years

###### have neural networks
Data needs to be processed. There are probably infinite ways of doing that,
depending on the goal that needs to be achieved. The first smart thing we want
to solve is to make Anna understand human language. So we need to come up with
a concept of processing and finally understanding human language. Conceptual
work and experimenting will be the key here.

###### understand human language
Reaching this level is in my opinion key to go further with all other smart
achievements Anna can make. Understanding humans, its terminology and meanings
of language will make interactions with Anna more easy. Pushing her into
certain directions of thinking by interacting with her could prove her real
power of inteligence.

###### be distributed
Being distributed is necssary to at least deal with huge amounts of data. It is
also possible to also partition different types or parts of neural networks
across physical machines or the like. Being distributed comes along with a
whole lot of problems we need to find solutions for. Lets start small and grow,
and see where the challenges are.

###### replicate herself
To make Anna self replicatable she needs to initialize a fresh copy of herself
and finally teardown her old replica. For distributed nodes this needs to be
coordinated as well.

---

###### rewrite your own code
Once capable of understanding human language it should be possible to
understand her own code. With achieving this level Anna should be able to
rewrite her own code and evolve on her own.
