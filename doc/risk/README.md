# risk
AI holds huge potentials of risk once it reached a irreversable or harmful
level. Whenever a new level is about to be reached, we need to think about
risks and steps to lower it. IMO, at the current stage of this project there
are no steps necessary to be done, since Anna, for now, is not able to do
anything uncontrolable.
